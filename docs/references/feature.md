# HedgePlus Features

## Autonomous and Hyper Deflationary Coin

HedgePlus — An Autonomous and Hyper Deflationary Coin. With our unique HPLUS token, you can stake, farm, and Defi with peace of mind.

Every network transaction burns ~2% of its value via our hyper deflationary mechanism, meaning supply is self-limiting! HedgePlus Ventures will also use a share of revenues they receive to buy back and burn tokens, reducing supply even further.

More than this, use HPLUS to collateralize loans, gain early access to exclusive events and discounts on platform features. By orientating toward organic growth through scarcity and market demand, HPLUS is redefining the Defi ecosystem.

## MetaVerse NFT Game

The MetaVerse offers new users a fun and easy entry to the world of Defi with streamlined access to immersive 3D gameplay, fractional ownership, and exclusive digital collectibles.

Digital assets obtained in the Metaverse are like any other physical asset. They are on-chain, meaning they're tradable via third-party platforms and entirely under your control at all times. Working with top-tier partners in the gaming and NFT collectible industries, we are building an interconnected and seamless VR world with its own Marketplace, Game, Social experiences, and Virtual Land ownership.

Battle, breed, trade, and upgrade in-game characters. A limited supply of destructible in-game assets! Items destroyed in battle become rarer (and more valuable!?). Progress through battle, stake, and farm your characters to earn rewards, including rare NFT items.

## Liquidity Mining & Utilization Rewards

We double rewards for liquidity providers who supply the HedgePlus Liquidity Pools. So, on top of the trading fee commissions, you’ll earn through the DEX, we allocate reward tokens to each pool to distribute proportionally between all LP token holders.

Why do we do this? Incentivizing HedgePlus LPs with rewards ensures our pools remain deep, our holders stay strong, and we offer seamless market orders, arbitrage opportunities, and more!

## Farming and Staking

HedgePlus offers hyper-optimized cross-chain yield farms designed to make compounding assets fun through gamification systems, giving you complete control over assets while maximizing rates of return, all with minimal friction.

Using the best decentralized, complex, and audited yield farming strategies, HedgePlus simplifies the process for all. HedgePlus Vaults are blockchain agnostic, which means they’re optimized for risk-adjusted yields and economical with gas costs.

With the ability to track and manage your yield farming on the HedgePlus platform, you can enjoy Defi more effectively using our seamless overview of holdings. We promise the best-in-class user experience.
