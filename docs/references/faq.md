# Frequently Asked Questions

## What is HedgePlus's mission?

HedgePlus's mission is to make Defi easy, safe, and accessible to more people.

## Have the HedgePlus token contracts been audited?

Yes, HedgePlus Smart contracts and related source materials were audited by independent security researchers. We are hiring a top Smart Contract Audit Company to go through the smart contracts and implement a comprehensive audit before launching. Security for users is a top priority at HedgePlus. We will run one of the more extensive bounty programs in the space ($250,000), and we will be teaming up with [Immunefi](https://immunefi.com/) to give it more visibility. Of course, we cannot guarantee that bugs won't be found in the future.

## Is HedgePlus Cross-Chain Compatible?

HedgePlus is a Multichain Defi Ecosystem, which features Cross-chain, P2P, and Instant Swaps across Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain & Polygon (Matic) blockchains.
